# fluseason

A fictional medical staffing agency provides temporary workers to clinics and hospitals across the United States on an as-needed basis. This project's objective is to help the medical staffing agency prepare for influenza season, a time when staff is in high demand.

This analysis uses Excel to find trends in influenza to plan for staffing needs across the country. Flu death data is used from the [CDC](www.cdc.gov) along with population data from the [U.S. Census Bureau](www.census.gov). The final deliverable is a Tableau story board.
